###Pros and Cons jQuery

####Pros:
-Easy to use
  -Compared to Raw JavaScript and other JavaScript libraries, jQuery 
	is easy to use and learn. The syntax is easy and uses much less 
	code to achieve the same goal.
-Lots of possibilities
  -JQuery provides lots of possibilities to accomplish your goal. 
	It had lots of functies compared to the other JavaScript libraries. 
	You don't need to use other libraries which means you only have 
	to learn one language.
-Great documentation and tutorials
  -The jQuery websites provides you with lots of information, which 
	means even a beginner in programming can learn this language.

####Cons:
-JQuery.js file is required
  -To be able to use jQuery you need to use the jQuery.js file. Although 
	this file has a very small file-size, it's still a strain on the users 
	computer. Even when the file is uploaded on your own server.
-Functionality may be limited
  -However jQuery provides lots of possibilities, compared to Raw JavaScript
	 these possibilities are often limited. With the use of Raw JavaScript 
	 you can accomplish more than jQuery can offer you.
-Updates
  -The jQuery file you have to use, is updated regularly. With these updates,
	some functions might behave differently. When you work with something 
	like bootstrap, you have to know that these things also have restrictions 
	to what version is compatible. It can't be to new, but also not to old. 
	You have to update your file quite frequently
